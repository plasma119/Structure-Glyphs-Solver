### Glyphs puzzle:
A fully unlocked puzzle reveals a 26x26 glyphs grid, starting from AA to ZZ, with some glyphs being green.

To solve the puzzle you must find a sequence of green glyphs where each glyphs have a matching ending letter to the next glyphs

i.e. ```AC CH HE EN```

Then chaining all of the glyphs together

i.e. ```ACHEN```


It is possible to have more than 1 possible solution, or even a looping sequence.

### Number puzzle:
A fully unlocked puzzle reveals 26 alphabets paired with a number and a sequence of numbers.

To solve the puzzle you must first resolve the sequence of numbers into glyphs by finding the correct pair of alphabets.

i.e. 
```
A - 1, B - 2, C - 3, D - 4 ...    
2, 6, 12
-> AB, BC, CD
```

Then solve the glyphs the same as above.


There is no direct indicataion of alphabe order when translating from numbers

i.e. Number ```2``` from previous example can be interpreted as both ```AB``` and ```BA```

But the previous/next glyph can provide hint to the alphabet order.
